# milkman

Milkman is my first vanilla JavaScript project, where I combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fun and interactive web application. The project taught me essential concepts like DOM manipulation and state management. Users can click the cow to produce milk, sell it for cash, and reinvest in various milk-producing assets, each with its own rate of production. This project not only showcases my front-end development skills but also demonstrates my ability to create engaging user interfaces while managing game-like mechanics.
